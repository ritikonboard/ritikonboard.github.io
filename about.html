                            So it took me almost 3 months to come back here and write something. I came back with the thought 
                            of removing the below article but now I think that I should just keep it as it is because these 
                            thoughts are mine.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Bon Iver is playing in the background as I write this, I'll write this along with the album 
                            'Bon Iver, Bon Iver'. Holocene has started.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            I have this year to make it all happen, and this will be the defining year. I have held myself 
                            back for too long now, but not anymore. I had a discussion with my friend and we came up with 
                            an idea to write down 12 things that I will be doing this year as video titles. These will be 
                            some of the major things that I will be working on/doing this year, starting today.

                            I still don't know what to write here after keeping this section empty for almost 3 months now. 
                            Was just updating something else on my webpage and thought of writing something here today.
                        </p>

                            With only around 3 months remaining, I feel a sense of urgency and the need to do something 
                            significant for myself. It has been a tough time, and if I keep going like this then it will 
                            be worse. I can sense that.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            There's a constant battle within between dreams and reality every single day. I believe my life 
                            lies in the intersection, and that I can't let any one of them go. And I know it is going to 
                            be hell tough.
                        </p>

                            I remember reading this in my Hindi textbook in school, and recently a few random events led 
                            me to come across these words again. I have no idea how I'll be doing it but I know one thing 
                            that I am not letting my dreams die.
